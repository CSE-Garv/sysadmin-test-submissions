# SAIC SysAdminTest'23

My little efforts for [sysadmin-test(2023)](https://github.com/saic-iitmandi/sysadmin-test/blob/main/2023/challenges.md) :) .

All the help I took are mentioned in the markdownfile of each challenge. For **Docker** and **Docker-related stuff** [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/) have been a real help.
